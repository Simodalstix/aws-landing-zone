Production-ready AWS Landing Zone using CDK with enterprise organizational structure, governance, and security baseline.

## Why This Matters

Setting up AWS at enterprise scale requires careful planning of account structure, security baselines, and governance. This landing zone provides a battle-tested foundation that:

- **Reduces setup time** from months to days
- **Enforces security best practices** from day one
- **Scales with your organization** as you grow
- **Maintains compliance** with automated governance

## Architecture

### Organizational Structure

- **Core Accounts**: Security, Log Archive, Audit, Shared Services
- **Workload Accounts**: Dev, Staging, Production
- **OUs**: Security OU, Workloads OU, Sandbox OU

### Security Baseline

- GuardDuty threat detection
- Security Hub centralized findings
- Config rules for compliance
- KMS centralized key management
- Cross-account IAM roles

### Networking Foundation

- Transit Gateway hub-and-spoke model
- Standardized VPC templates
- Network segmentation and security groups

### Governance & Compliance

- Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- Organization-wide CloudTrail
- Budget controls and monitoring
- Automated compliance checking

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** AWS CLI configured, Node.js 20+, Python 3.9+

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install -g aws-cdk

# Configure your settings
# Edit src/config/landing_zone_config.py

# Bootstrap CDK (one-time setup)
cdk bootstrap

# Deploy landing zone
cdk deploy --all
```

## Key Features

- **Single Responsibility**: Each construct handles one specific concern
- **Modularity**: Reusable constructs for common patterns
- **Security First**: Multi-layered security with centralized management
- **Compliance Ready**: Automated governance and monitoring
- **Scalable**: Hub-and-spoke networking with proper segmentation

## Configuration

Customize your deployment by editing `src/config/landing_zone_config.py`:

- **Account emails** - Update with your organization's email addresses
- **Network CIDRs** - Adjust IP ranges for your network design
- **Security settings** - Configure compliance and monitoring preferences
- **Organizational units** - Define your account structure

## Deployment

Stacks deploy in dependency order automatically. Manual order if needed:

1. **Core Stack** - Organization and accounts
2. **Security Stack** - Security baseline
3. **Network Stack** - Transit Gateway and shared VPC
4. **Workload Stack** - Environment VPCs
